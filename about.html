      <p> Help is a fundraising website developed in october 2021 to help raise funds for
        local charity organizations in Bhutan such as <a href="https://www.bhutansociety.org/trustfund.html">
          The Bhutan Society Trust Fund </a>, <a href="http://bhutancancersociety.org/">
       Bhutan cancer society</a>, <a href="https://www.bkfbhutan.org/"> Bhutan kidney Foundation</a>
        and many more who are dedicated to provide social, spiritual, and financial support to affected individuals.</p>
         <p>Like many other non-profit organizations, the non-profit organizations in Bhutan also struggle with
        insufficient funding associated to increased demand for their services.</p>
        <p> It is important that the organizations achieve financial sustainability in order to provide services to those affected with renewed interest
        and promt actions.</p>
       <p>One of the ways to help the organizations ensure sustainable finance is through fundraising.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>It would be of an immense help if you can donate any amount either directly to those
        mentioned websites or through this Help website and make life easier for those affected.</p>
